**Project Explanation: Automated 4-DOF Robotic Arm**

**Introduction:**
This is a 4-DOF acrylic robotic arm that we automated using an Arduino. The project was assigned to us during our 4th semester, and we successfully implemented a **teach-and-repeat** system for object picking and placing.

**Hardware Used:**
- 4 DOF robotic arm (acrylic structure)
- Arduino (for control and automation)
- 4 Servo motors (for movement)
- 2 Joysticks (for manual control)
- 2 Push buttons (for automation recording)

**Working Principle:**
1. **Manual Control Mode:**
   - The robotic arm is manually controlled using two joysticks:
     - One joystick controls the **left and right** servo motors.
     - The other joystick controls the **base and jar** servo motors.

2. **Recording the Pick and Drop Positions:**
   - When no buttons are pressed, the joystick normally controls the robotic arm.
   - When the **first push button** is pressed, the arm records the **pick position** where the object is picked up.
   - When the **same button** is pressed again, the arm records the **drop position** where the object is placed.
   
3. **Automated Motion Replay:**
   - After recording both pick and drop positions, pressing the button again triggers **automatic repetition** of the motion.
   - The arm will continuously repeat the pick-and-drop sequence without manual control.

**Conclusion:**
This project successfully demonstrates a **semi-automated** robotic arm that learns movements and repeats them. Such a system can be used for **industrial automation, pick-and-place operations, and robotic learning applications.**

This was an exciting project, and we learned a lot about **servo control, Arduino programming, and automation techniques.**
